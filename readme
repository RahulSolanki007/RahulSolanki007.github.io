# DevOps Portfolio

Welcome to my DevOps portfolio! This repository showcases my skills, projects, and experience in the field of **DevOps**, with a focus on automating and streamlining development, deployment, and infrastructure management processes.

## About Me

I am a passionate **DevOps Engineer** with experience in **CI/CD**, **cloud infrastructure**, **containerization**, and **version control**. My goal is to enable faster, more efficient software delivery through automation, collaboration, and scalability. I believe in the power of integrating development and operations to create seamless workflows that drive business success.

## Skills

Here are some of the core skills I have developed over time:

- **CI/CD** (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
  - Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI, Travis CI
  - Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines
  - Integration with cloud platforms and containerization tools
- **Containerization & Orchestration**
  - Docker, Kubernetes, Docker Compose
  - Building and managing containerized applications
  - Orchestrating microservices using Kubernetes
- **Cloud Computing**
  - AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
  - Infrastructure provisioning and management with CloudFormation, Terraform
  - Serverless computing using AWS Lambda
- **Version Control**
  - Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
  - Branching strategies, pull requests, code reviews
  - Collaborating in version-controlled environments
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
  - AWS CloudFormation, Terraform
  - Defining and managing infrastructure using code
  - Automating resource provisioning and scaling
- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  - Setting up and maintaining monitoring and logging for infrastructure and applications
- **Scripting & Automation**
  - Bash, Python, PowerShell
  - Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, deployments, and monitoring

## Projects

This repository includes a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in DevOps, including but not limited to:

### 1. **CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application**

- **Technologies used**: CircleCI, AWS, Docker, Nginx
- **Description**: This project demonstrates an automated CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys a simple web application to AWS EC2 using Docker and Nginx as a reverse proxy. The pipeline automates the entire process, ensuring faster and more reliable deployments.

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code with AWS CloudFormation**

- **Technologies used**: AWS CloudFormation, EC2, S3, VPC
- **Description**: Iâ€™ve written CloudFormation templates to provision AWS resources, including EC2 instances, VPCs, and S3 buckets. This project shows how to use IaC for consistent, reproducible infrastructure provisioning.

### 3. **Dockerized Microservices Architecture**

- **Technologies used**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Node.js, MongoDB
- **Description**: In this project, I containerized a set of microservices using Docker and orchestrated them using Kubernetes on AWS. The application uses a Node.js backend and MongoDB for data storage.

### 4. **Automated Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**

- **Technologies used**: Terraform, AWS
- **Description**: I created Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources like EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases. This demonstrates how to use Terraform for infrastructure automation and cloud provisioning.

### 5. **AWS Lambda Functions for Event-Driven Architecture**

- **Technologies used**: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the use of AWS Lambda for creating serverless functions that trigger on events such as file uploads to S3 or API calls via API Gateway. It shows how to build scalable, event-driven applications with minimal infrastructure.
